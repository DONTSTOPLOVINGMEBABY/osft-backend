1. caching

2. minor organizational things + tweaks 

3. Maybe a few features that are needed to make api work 

4. Fix error messages for caching







Caching 
-----------------------



We have two sets of keys in the cache for a given project at any point in time : 
    1. Production Api Key 
    2. Developmnent Api Key 

If a change is made to a production enabled feature, then the productionApiKey and its associated
value in the cache need to be removed. The same holds true for developmentApiKey. 





CACHING 2.0 

Split the primary building and caching functions into two categories : 

    1. Development

    2. Production

Anything that requires a developmentEnabled or productionEnabled change needs to be split into its own respective route 

Anything that affects both e.g. a variable being deleted, requires both to be rebuilt

Also, every admin web app route is going to require a parentProjectName in the body or somewhere therein
